# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku Solver using Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and Local Search algorithms


This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at the University of Padova.

It implements a classic Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm in Python, inside a Jupyter Notebook. The program takes a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board and attempts to fill in the missing numbers while respecting Sudoku rules.
